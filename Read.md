This project is made entirely using code from the book by JON DUCKETTE 'HTML & CSS' which for me is one of the 
best book for any novice to start learning HTML & CSS,
after careful study i recreated the final project on the book.
This project was design using the grid system for the layout. i had to do a bit adjustment on the header different from what was in the code in the book.

The purpose of this project is get hands on practical of what I studied in the book and see how this selectors affect my page in HTML especially how to give layout to my page via the grid.

This are images of the final outcome.
